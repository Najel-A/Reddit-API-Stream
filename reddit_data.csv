Psychosis and psychotic episodes,"Hello everyone I am looking for advice regarding an incident that happened with my teenage son He had a sudden psychological experience where he began to suffer from a psychotic episode He was with us in the car then suddenly got out and ran into the street in a state of unconsciousness asking for help from passersby I tried to calm him down but he didnt respond Fortunately he has now regained his awareness and is trying to recover

I am very concerned about his mental state right now Do you think this could be the beginning of a longterm mental illness Is it possible for him to stay in this state or improve I am also worried that he might have been filmed or a video of him in an unconscious state on the street could have been posted and I really dont want that to affect his personal or social future

Do you have any advice on how to handle this situation Should I seek urgent medical help for him Thank you so much for your time and assistance",Positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1iz2u4x/psychosis_and_psychotic_episodes/

Need Help Visa Concerns,"I am an accepted student for the Masters 2025S program university of wein

I received my admission letter on February 25 but the semester begins on March 1 which makes it challenging to secure my visa in time

As a nonEU student obtaining the visa is realistically very difficult under these circumstances I have contacted the school regarding this issue but they mentioned that they cannot extend the valid date on my certificate

At this point I am unsure about what steps I can take I am considering the following options

1 Pay the tuition fee but not attend any classes on paper starting in the summer semester while actually beginning in the winter semester
2 Pay the tuition fee and register for only one class thereby effectively dropping the remaining courses

1 Test if there is an active leak As of right now I do not see a significant drop in water level NOR any visible water on the ground near the aboveground Jacuzzi jacuzzi since December 2024

Arsenal: my personal take on the current state of affairs,"TLDR anyone who thinks injuries and the lack of a 9 are our only issues is deluded We lack creativity going forwards and are easy to nullify Some of the red cards have been justified some not It is not a sufficient excuse for our current position MLS and Nwaneri have the potential to turn us into a title winning team if accompanied by 1 or 2 good signings Not all good Not all bad Discussions like these require nuance

I dont have much data to back any of this up so I apologise in advance Most of what Im about to say is just purely based on my observations whilst watching us

It seems as though just from some scrolling down the sub there isnt much nuance in a lot of the fan bases opinions It seems as though many are calling for Artetas head on a stick whilst many think he is an absolute angel and can do no wrong In reality I think its somewhere in the middle Id say whilst Im not Arteta out I would lean towards the more negative side of things

First off Ill start with some of our bad luck As to the red cards I think the Rice one was somewhat unlucky even if he did delay the restart Veltman shouldve been sent off too I think Trossards was somewhat justified If were being honest no player that is actually trying to continue on with play just smacks the ball straight up in the air He knew the whistle was about to blow and it was dumb behaviour Granted that the rules havent been applied even close to consistently with kicking the ball away and delaying the restart but we should be aware of Michael Olivers atrocious record against us and thus be more careful Even if Trossards red card was an absolute robbery we can only really argue that red cards have costed us 4 points this season The saliba and MLS red card against West Ham were justified 

Next up the injuries

 Saka I think we all can agree was overused by Arteta Even with opportunities to give him proper rest like the Bolton game he still played Jesus I think we can attribute down to poor luck He hasnt played much football in the past two seasons Martinelli maybe an argument for slight overuse but I think his rotation has been adequate from the back end of last season into this one Havertz definite overuse although he was never the answer to any of our problems Ode definite overuse although you could argue that Artetas hand was kind of forced We dont have anyone good enough to start taking substantial minutes off of him despite in my opinion his bad form this season 

The problem of scoring goals 

Despite our defence not quite setting the levels they did last year I think we can all agree that theyre far from the problem Gabi XL would probably be my pick right now for player of the season Whilst yes not having a proper world class 9 is a massive problem anyone who is acting like the lack of a 9 and injuries are our only problems is massively deluded We show no creativity or ingenuity We play slow tepid side to side football and make little attempt to break the lines We are the worst team in the league for forward ball progression through the middle third pitch split lengthways and half spaces Everything we do is in front of the opponent and thus it is easy to read and nullify with a low block Even when we get an opportunity to attack quickly like a poor corner from the opposition or a quick turnover it seems like we are adamant that the opposition need to get back into shape before we can attack Most of the players look like theyre fine with us not scoring which is worrying to see To those who say not having a 9 is the biggest issue we are the highest xG out performers in the league Over 27 games that should be fairly representative of how clinical you are relative to the other teams I think in around 50 dont quote me on that of our last 40ish games we have scored one or zero goals That is very concerning for a team that is supposed to be competing for the title

Some good now

Defensively we are very solid Least amount of goals conceded least amount of xG conceded and least amount of open play xG conceded I think although there is room for improvement on this season we cannot blame the defence in the slightest for how this season is going 

Youth prospects both MLS and nwaneri look like the real deals  Arteta is doing a good job of guiding them into first team football Not overplaying but giving plenty of experience impressive given our current injuries With them coming through were probably only two signings away from having a title winning starting XI given we can shed some of our tactical rigidity

Control we have shown the ability to have large amounts of possession and play pretty easy football Could mean that if we sort out our creativity issue somehow and manage to regularly score multiple goals in the first 60 minutes of games we could see a massive improvement in how good we are Not only of course due to the goals but the ability to preserve ourselves more over the course of a season leaving more in reserve for the biggest games allowing us to dominate those games physically 

In conclusion I think our main issue is tactical rigidity and a lack of creativity not the absence of a world class 9 like some people try to make out is our only issue The signing of a world class 9 in conjunction with increased license for the players to be creative would make our starting XI title worthy I still think more reinforcements are required in midfield and attack specifically but we have bigger fish to fry as of right now",Positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArsenalFC/comments/1iz2u9f/arsenal_my_personal_take_on_the_current_state_of/

Here is a hypothesis: Physical laws emerge from pattern dynamics between two density states rather than being fundamental,"Im presenting this hypothesis for rigorous stress testing by the community Ive developed a mathematical framework that explores whether spacetime forces and quantum behaviors naturally emerge from the interaction of two fundamental density states ρ₁ ρ₂

The nature of these density states and their mathematical properties are fully developed in Volume 1 of the framework Despite its mathematical simplicity this approach naturally resolves several major problems in theoretical physics from the quantum measurement problem to force unification through a unified mathematical structure governed by the density correction factor γρ  1  ρ₂ρ₁¹² Volume 2 applies this framework to derive quantum mechanics from first principles and unify the fundamental forces

Im seeking critical analysis to identify mathematical inconsistencies conflicts with established experimental results or logical gaps in the derivations The full mathematical development is available at 

 Problems Addressed by the Framework

Specific Predictions

This framework makes several specific quantifiable predictions that differentiate it from standard physics

1 Force Unification Exact convergence of coupling constants at EU  2  10¹⁶ GeV with unified coupling αU  1256 contrasting with the nearmiss of standard unification models
2 Bell Inequality Violations Enhanced violations by factor γρ for entangled systems in specific configurations potentially reaching SCHSH  566 versus the standard quantum mechanical maximum of 22  283
3 Vacuum Energy Density The regulated vacuum energy density predicts a value of ρvac  10³ eV⁴ consistent with cosmological observations without finetuning
4 Casimir Force Modification At plate separations of 5 nm the measured force should exceed the standard prediction by 08  02 providing an accessible experimental test

Request for Critical Assessment  
I welcome critique on

 Mathematical Consistency  Are there regimes where γρ breaks down
 Experimental Conflicts  Do any existing results contradict these predictions
 Derivation Gaps  Are there key phenomena this framework fails to derive
 Crucial Experiments  What tests could validate or disprove this hypothesis

This framework avoids speculative assumptions like extra dimensions or supersymmetry relying instead on established mathematics to make testable predictions

I welcome all feedbackespecially rigorous challenges counterexamples or experimental tests that refine or disprove this approach

Future volumes will expand on additional topics including detailed derivations of the Standard Model nonAbelian gauge theories and cosmological implications as the framework continues to develop

Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to engage with this I appreciate the opportunity to stresstest these ideas with the community

Help with Defilereenie,"Originally I wanted to make a pioneer white deck that used the sinergy between Defiler of Faith Oketras Monument and Mentor of the Meek basically spamming tons of creatures while keeping the gas


Of course the combination of them is pretty heavy and uncommon specially the Defiler for the white aggro core and that is the reason why I choosed pioneer over modern


Btw I putted some soul bros like Lunarch Veteran and Hinterland Sanctifier to ensure that the Defiler doesnt hurt too much and some nerfed Mentor like pieces like Welcoming Vampire and Tocasias Welcome


Them I figured out seeing other related decks that would be nice to merge with some colors a mistake but I ensure it 


 blue with Azorius Aggro gave me Niambi Steemed Speaker Deputy of Acquitals and Yorion as companion

 green gave me Torens Fist of the Angels Voice of Ressurgence Katilda Dawnhart Prime Knight of Autumn Nissa Voice of Zendikar and Huatli Radiant Champion

 At least red gave me Warleaders Call and the feeling to try it modern instead of pioneer cause it have General Ferrous Rokiric that is amazing on a 34 color deck so I could try them all I certainly gave up this idea


That said I putted too tons of remotion creatures to have mid level control and  I coudnt remove the idea from paper

Sources for News?,"Hey yall

Trying to do some researchget some opinions from the community here Ive been in the miniatures scene for about 10 years now keeping up with GW news the whole time of course but Ive really always loved following what was going on with midrange and smaller companies and picking up miniatures here and there even if they werent games I was actively playing The wargaming landscape has changed so much in that time with Wahammer Community really taking over the news space and it feeling a lot harder to see news from smaller companies outside of just following their socials directly Even then some companies are certainly better at advertising for themselves than others Looking at the launches of Warmachine Mk4 and Infinity N5 it really seemed like only the most entrenched players really knew what was going on 

All this to say I am currently considering building a site to aggregate news in the wider wargaming world to make it easier for people who are interested in more than just Warhammer to follow what is happening with various companies and help shine a spotlight on the smallest companies who struggle to get the word out To that end I have a few questions to hopefully generate some good discussion

  
1 Is there a widely used site like this already out there that I dont know about I havent used BOLS in years but they seem to be just as GW focused as they ever were I know there were a lot of people back in what I would consider their heyday who didnt like their editorialization and the fact that they were 90 a rumor mill Do many people currently follow them Same for Beast of War They had a much smaller focus on GW and it was nice that they highlighted a variety of games but all of the content on their site always felt like sponsored content to me

  
2 Where do you get your news currently Do you feel like you are seeing a variety of content with out actively seeking it out Or just the gamescompanies you are actively following with the occasion viral breakout eg Trench Crusade

  
3 Would you be interested in a site like this What form would you be most likely to follow eg Discord Instagramother social media posts Youtube recaps the site itself

  
4 What aspects of your current new sources do you like If you have used BOLS BOW or another similar site before what aspects of them do you like

  
5 Same question but what do you dislike or would like to see improved

  
6 On Ads and sponsored content I know a lot of people dont like when sites feature a ton of ads eg Spikeybits and Fauxhammer especially intrusive ones What aspects of ads would you consider acceptable vs drive you to be disinterested in using the site Same question goes for sponsored content I would never want sponsored content to be a main focus but I could see certain types of content being okay

  
7 And finally what other content would you like to see on a site like this I am currently thinking things like release archives event coverage product reviews some editorials and landing pages for various games with general info comparisons to other games and resources for getting started playing Id love to hear your ideas

Fox Taming 101: How to Befriend the Furry Speedster,"So youve gone and tried to domesticate a fox and now it is racing away from you as though you just shared some bad news with it Classic huh They just arent as trusting as wolves or cats But dont worry about it  you can still win it over at least keep it around

First off capture the foxes

Foxes show up in taiga biomesthat is in cold pinefilled forests In case you are fortunate you might spot the more elusive snow fox in snowy taigas

Alright step two collect some berries

Foxes totally adore those little sweet berries the ones that rip you up a little bit whenever you brush by them Pick a big ol handful and approach quietlydont run or you will be outta that spot

Step 3 Connect with love bro Feed a couple foxes honeyed berries and prestothey will have a foal The foal will not be afraid of you though it will stay with its free parents

Step 4 The Great Kidnaping

This part is a little sketchy To claim the baby as really yours just take a lead and just take a wander Once it is away from its parents it will be totally trusting and not try to run away Great job Youve got yourself a pet fox that will not listen really at all but will adorably tag you around Bonus Why bother Tamed foxes are really coolthey will swipe at you like imagine a fox with a sword jump on chickens and tackle danger in the form of zombies if you dont freak out But seriously keep them away from berberies They have no sense of directions",Positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestGameServerHosting/comments/1iz2v5d/fox_taming_101_how_to_befriend_the_furry_speedster/
"Should I move my family to Gilbert, AZ or Long Beach, CA?","We have two babies and I think Id make enough to support us in either city I would make more in Long Beach because of the wage differences but basically in my first year in Gilbert Id make around 70000 after taxes and then get a 4 pay increase every year for 11 years My first year in Long Beach Id be making roughly 115000 after taxes and then get a 6 pay raise every year for at least 11 years

We wont need childcare because my wife would only be working 34 days per month on a flex schedule as a registered nurse so shell be home most of the time and shell also be able to pay her own car note and insurance while I cover the rest of our expenses

So under these circumstances which city would you move to if you were me We dont mind not owning a home in Long Beach if thats where we went but I would still want to be able to comfortably afford renting an apartment and eventually a 3 bedroom townhouse condo or house without struggling 

Our lifestyle is nothing crazy we cook at home for the most part but like to eat out as a family on weekends or get takeout on sundays See a movie once in a while thats about it Were not shopaholics

Hello Cousin! This American needs help!,"After my greatgrandfather left for the United States he took the name Brown the second most common last name in the English Speaking world and shed his surname of Kiškis

Im aware the name Kiškis means hare as in a rabbit in Lithuanian but I am almost certain that my ancestors living or dead are from Latvia 

I would appreciate any information you guys have and it would mean so much I have always wanted to reconnect with my ancestry in hopes to eventually retake the surname as my own Once I feel as if I have learned enough Thank you

How do I stop comparing myself to better looking men? There's too much evidence stating that handsome men have an easier time in life.,"I 27m would consider myself an average looking guy Im not ugly by any means but Im certainly not handsome

Every time I see a handsome man Im always reminded of how things are often easier for them

Dating Tinder Job interviews and general everyday politeness from others Basically I 100 believe that pretty privilege is real

When it comes to dating I understand that social skills confidence charisma charm etc are all important Considering I dont have any of those things Ive been single my whole life

In regards to job interviews youve got a much easier chance of being hired as a handsome man rather than an overweight neckbeard

Social media is built for attractive people nothing more needed to be said

And no Im not an incel as incels blame others for their problems

I think its great if men want to become more handsome as theres genuinely no reason not to but that doesnt change the fact that I feel inadequate when I see the success that my handsome friends seem to come by easily

Is it a bad idea to let a player be connected to the Arcane Brotherhood?,"So Im reworking the character secrets for my campaign I wanted secrets that all had a mechanical benefit to encourage players to take them and reduce feel bads about the good ones and also tied more directly into the story 

One of the ones Ive come up with is being a former apprentice to someone in the Arcane Brotherhood I really like the idea conceptually but I havent run the campaign before so not sure if Im missing something that makes a player having that connection a bad idea

My plan would be that if they have that secret they left the brotherhood prior to the plan to come to Icewind Dale so they dont necessarily have extra insight into why theyre here and being an apprentice meant they never got exposed to high level secrets Id likely make their mentor someone unnamed and not one of the people here though I could see that being a fun option as well",Positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/rimeofthefrostmaiden/comments/1iz2v84/is_it_a_bad_idea_to_let_a_player_be_connected_to/

I was a 23 year old male working my first job out of college doing data entry after hours for pharmaceutical research company start up My supervisor was a 31 year old white woman seemed very flighty not very sure of herself or at least had trouble conversing because shed make off handed comments that seemed out of place 

Often times shed work late and it would just be us there at night She bought me dinner a couple timespizza and we would eat together and talk in her office A couple times she made her way to my office and would lay on my office floor with all her work spread out so she wouldnt feel alone in a big office at night 

One night we were talking while I was working her in the floor my back to her entering data and she starts asking me questions about my life Where I went to school my interests if I had any pets etc and then she got to my age and I thought wed discussed it prior but when I told her I was 23 she seemed shocked She joked that us being there together someone could get the wrong idea and that I could be her little summer fling and that she had to watch herself 

At the time I was extremely clueless about women flirting with me still am actually so I laughed and said You dont have to worry about me Scouts honor Besides Im a GENTLEMAN and I kind of jokingly winked at her 

At which point she seemed to quit working late at that point and we never were alone in the same office at night 

So either I scared her into thinking I was secretly a predator or something or she lost interest in me 

TLDR I worked with my boss after dark she may have hit on me but I dont know I may have scared her with ever approaching me again after that night",Negative,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manipulation/comments/1iz2ubo/did_my_boss_hit_on_me/

Give him a second chance?,"After a painful breakup with my ex who cheated on me I 39M decided to try dating apps Thats where I met him 37M At first he wasnt my type but our conversations revealed how much we had in commonboth married to women in the past both seeking a monogamous relationship in a community where that feels rare Hed been out for five years and said he was ready for something serious so we met in person  

From the moment we met there was a spark Our first dateminigolf and drinkswas amazing and things quickly escalated Within 5 months we were practically living together for 3 of them He met all my love languages acts of service and quality time and introduced me to words of affirmation which I didnt realize I needed He was sweet affectionate and made me feel special every day Even the sex was incrediblethe best Ive ever had

We built trust early on We shared locations and passcodesnot out of control but mutual care When he went out for drinks after work one night which was 15hrs away I asked him to share his location in case anything happened He forgot to turn it off but it gave me peace of mind after being cheated on before and I shared mine as well He was always upfronteven telling me when guys flirted with him onlineand it made me feel secure

But then came our first hiccup About 2 months in I noticed a flirty message hed sent to someone on Instagram after we were already together Thanks but not as sexy as you It stung When I brought it up he admitted it was inappropriate and promised not to do it again Over time he worked to reassure mehe even created a Close Friends list on Instagram to announce our relationship and told flirty guys he couldnt talk like that anymore out of respect for me and our relationship

By 45 months things felt perfect He met my family during the holidays told me he loved me and even introduced me to his daughtersomething he said hed never done before because he only wanted her to meet someone serious We started talking about the future him moving closer or even us getting a place together

Then everything fell apart

One night after his overnight shift I noticed his location lingering near my building but not coming home right away My mind racedthere were known hookup spots nearbyand when he finally came home 40 minutes later sweaty and acting off I couldnt shake my suspicion The next morning I set an alarm to check his location again and saw him stop at a gas station for an unusually long time Out of paranoia I checked Sniffies and saw a profile moving in his same direction

I messaged the anonymous profile pretending to be someone elseand my worst fears were confirmed when he sent me his picture and said they were down for CarPlay I confronted him that night when he arrived at the agreed spot instead of meeting up with the stranger He apologized profusely but admitted there was no excuse for what he did I kicked him out

Four days later I had him come back to pick up his remaining belongings and asked for clarity Why did he do it Had this happened before He swore it hadnt and explained that stress from work fear about how fast our relationship was moving and feelings of unworthiness led him to selfsabotage He claimed he wasnt planning on going through with anything but acknowledged how wrong it was to even entertain the idea

Despite everything part of me still believes in him Up until that point his actions always matched his words he made me feel loved and secure like no one else ever had And maybe thats why letting go is so hardI hate dating in todays world where people seem disposable or open relationships are the norm which isnt for me Hes sought therapy since our breakup and seems genuinely remorseful

Its been 15 months since we broke up and we agreed not to speak for 3 months while we heal individually Some friends think we can work through this and come out stronger others believe once a cheater always a cheater Im torn because I know people can grow from their mistakesI did after cheating on my exwife 16 years ago and never have ever again since thenbut rebuilding trust wouldnt be easy

For now Im focusing on myself while trying to figure out if this relationship deserves a second chanceor if its better left in the past

The question presented to the class in seminary one morning and the verse ah scripture that wonderful divinely approvedsource that provides the answer Yes I see I should turn to Sky Daddy for truth because as is plainly stated in the notatall suspicious book that Sky Daddys alleged prophets say is his word Sky Daddy knows everything and I am a stupid human that knows nothing

Do HMRC think I'm a millionaire?,"Hi all

Im just having some issues understanding my current tax code 602LX and my tax code for next year K408

For background I earn approx 40k a year as a nurse but Im fortunate enough to earn about 7k in interest payments a year not in an ISA or premium bonds

The only deductions for the current year which are listed as Untaxed interest on savings and investments are put at 67k which is then entirely put under total deductions and brings my personal allowance down to 6020 hence the 602LX tax code My understanding is that Id only pay 20 on any interest over 1k Does this mean that HMRC believe I earn 30k in interest payments a year I wish I did but I dont

Furthermore now for next year under my deductions not only do I have the same untaxed interest deduction I also have underpayment from previous year of 101k bringing my personal tax free allowance negative giving me the tax code k408

Im extremely confused I spoke to someone at HMRC today via the helpline but unfortunately they werent very helpful I couldnt really understand them and they didnt understand themself I do plan on calling again but I just dont understand where these figures are coming from

My previous tax years Ive always had the same standard tax free allowance and code 1257L do HMRC think Ive squirrelled away a load of cash somewhere or that Ive won the lottery but I dont know about it",Positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/1iz2ueo/do_hmrc_think_im_a_millionaire/
The rarity of being nurtured,"Ive 34M had a lot of wonderful experiences with partners of mine in a relatively short amount of time investing in this lifestyle Fun exciting lavish moments that were almost architected to bring us closer together and exemplify the flourish of sugar dating that attracts SDs and SBs alike One thing Ive yet to find  perhaps because Ive struggled to articulate it  is my respite A sacred space reserved for me to escape the Chicago hustle of things

Im in a phase of life now where the only thing I truly find myself wanting is someone who will welcome me to their place hold me stroke my hair and nurture away the stress of regular life Maintaining work home life and everything outside of sugar relationships often leaves me feeling pretty low and empty I feel a responsibility to shield those in my life from these moments but Im starting to want an SB who can help relieve the tension in slow soft moments together not spectacular or energizing ones

I suppose what Im saying is that I need encouragement that there are dynamics out there with this kind of nurturing relationship I crave safety acceptance affirmation and many of the things Im usually on the giving end of I know there is a level of maturity needed to understand and empathize with these struggles and Im not sure if many younger SBs are in the position to offer this kind of attentiveness Perhaps some of you have experience with SBs who are older and Id love to hear them 

Thanks for letting me vent and get these words out somewhere Ill plan to articulate something similar in my future proposals",Positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/1iz2uep/the_rarity_of_being_nurtured/

Stop hating on McNeil,"I know everyone hates on McNeil but I feel hes getting bashed because fans would rather see Acuna or Baty starting But the reality is when healthy McNeil is a versatile defensive player who hits for average and extends innings He got hot in the 2nd half of the season last year because he we was healthy and showed glimpses of his 2022 form 

With that said McNeil is the starting 2nd baseman on Opening Day but he will be on a tight leash The kids are going to get their opportunity and are part of our long term plan  if McNeil rebounds this year however it will be his job to lose Ultimately this is a good problem to have But Ive always liked McNeil when he was in true squirrel form

I was already to install a new operating system and start digging in to some retro gaming but the burning smell coming from the vents freaked me out and I powered off and unplugged the battery the laptop is in immaculate shape aside from electrical burning smell it didnt seem to be getting that warm either definitely a little warm on the left side but other than that nothing although I it only ran for about two minutes

ou could not live with your own failure. Where did that bring you? Back to me,"With the launch of Daredevil Born Again I cant help but look back and find it absurd how many unnecessary hoops Kevin Feige jumped through to distance the show from the Netflix canon and essence He brought in an unproven director and writers who were completely unsuited for the material I also felt like Daredevils portrayal in SheHulk felt off and Wilson Fisk in Hawkeye was reduced to a cartoonish caricature

All of this only to rework the show midproduction and aggressively pivot back to what made the Netflix series greatessentially giving us the season 4 fans have been asking for all along 

It really felt like Feige was trying to erase something that wasnt his and rebuild it from the ground up almost out of pride The Netflix Daredevil was a huge success without his involvement and given how dominant the MCU was at the time maybe he just couldnt accept that a Marvel property flourished outside his control Not sure if people are aware but at the time there was some tension between Feige and Marvel Televisions leadership particularly Jeph Loeb due to the corporate separation between Marvel Studios and Marvel Television 

Also still cant believe a show like DD was produced for 60M at the time and here we had Disney throwing 200M budget at shows which cant barely reach the same level of success Never was a fan of them really due to how short and inconsistent they were Like most of them had 6 episodes with a 30min runtime it was neither a full blown show nor quite a 5 hourlong movie 

In the end Im glad they retained the original cast and acknowledged that their initial approach wasnt working Heres hoping this lives up to the Netflix series and build upon it",Positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/Defenders/comments/1iz2umv/ou_could_not_live_with_your_own_failure_where_did/

Uso de aparelho ortodôntico após fratura radicular?,"Olá pessoal Busco orientações sobre meu caso

Tenho uma mordida classe III devido a um prognatismo mandibular que necessita de correção com cirurgia ortognática Sei que antes da cirurgia é necessário o uso de aparelho ortodôntico mas aí surge um problema

Há três anos sofri um trauma que resultou na fratura de um pequeno pedaço do meu incisivo central superior Além disso um raioX apontou uma fratura radicular oblíqua no terço médio Não tenho mais o exame em mãos mas a fratura era semelhante à que aparece na imagem anexada sem grande deslocamento das partes

Situação atual do dente

 O dente responde normalmente a temperaturas frias ou quentes
 Não há sensibilidade aumentada no dente
 Ao pinçar o dente entre os dedos e movimentar não há mobilidade excessiva parecendo se comportar como os dentes adjacentes porém ao pressionar e tentar movimentálo com os dedos percebo um leve desconforto  não chega a ser dor apenas uma sensação diferente dos outros dentes
 Na mastigação tudo é normal

A fratura nunca foi investigada a fundo A única dentista que consultei afirmou que a extração e o implante seriam obrigatórios o que me assustou e me fez adiar o tratamento Hoje não sei exatamente qual é a real condição do dente

Minha dúvida principal é seria possível usar aparelho ortodôntico mesmo com essa fratura Vale ressaltar que minha arcada superior precisa de poucos ajustes especialmente nos incisivos frontais

Outros fatores a considerar

 Se isso se fizer necessário para dar continuidade ao tratamento não tenho condições de pagar um implante agora Talvez no final do ano eu consiga juntar o valor cerca de R 3000
 Quero fazer a cirurgia ortognática dentro de no máximo três anos por que é quando eu entro no internato na faculdade de medicina por isso fico preocupado em ter que esperar um ano juntando dinheiro sendo que o uso de aparelho poderia demorar bastante A ortognática pelo SUS sai rápido aqui é quase certo que conseguiria fazer no próprio HU da minha faculdade em menos de 2 anos se já estivesse com tudo certo antes

Agradeço qualquer orientação Obrigado",Negative,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistas_Portugal/comments/1iz2up6/uso_de_aparelho_ortodôntico_após_fratura_radicular/

AITAH for considering to cut off ties with my parents who don't like the fact that my fiancé is disabled?,"So I26F have been on a relationship with my fiancé24M for 2 years now My fiancé is a complete quadriplegic who pretty much lacks independence on multiple things He uses an electric wheelchair to move around He has limited arm and hand mobility cant shower on his own needs diapers which someone has to help him change and needs special cutlery for him to eat I really dont mind his disability hes a great and smart guy with good personality who I find attractive and Im willing to help him on things he cant do

Our relationship is alright between us he works as a software engineer and makes a fair amount of money I work as a doctor at a hospital and earn somewhat more than him We both use our money for house expenses and we have been able to make our home accessible for him with an elevator an accessible bathroom and other things which are easier for him to use as a disabled person He also has an insurance that covers him some of the medical things he needs I also do all the house chores since my fiancé is unable but he helps me in other things like organizing plans things we need for the household and helps me to carry the things we buy on his lap while moving on his wheelchair

Unfortunately my parents are ableists ever since they met my fiancé they told me in private that they were afraid he was not gonna be able to be a good husband and that hes a weak man because hes disabled They told me that I would just be a caretaker around with him and would have an unhappy marriage because of him My parents are also conservative Christians so they ask me a lot when Im gonna have children and tell me that my fiancé would never be able to give me children I plan to have children with my fiancé in a few years later and through IVF but my parents also dont like the idea about IVF My parents neither like the fact that I was the one who proposed my fiancé marriage They also dont like the fact that my fiancé cant drive nor fix things around the house and they have told me hes less of a man because of that My fiancé doesnt know what my parents think of him but I really cant stand my parents telling me that my relationship is not gonna work

My fiancé and I are gonna get married in 6 months and I really feel bad that I wont invite my parents to my wedding due to the fact they dislike my boyfriend for being disabled Ive tried to convince my parents that Im happy with my fiancé and that our relationship is fine but their ableism doesnt go away I hope my parents can change but if they cant Im willing to cut off ties with them",Positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1iz2uqm/aitah_for_considering_to_cut_off_ties_with_my/
Asking for Advice Concerning a RN Displaying Immoral Behavior,"I am a recently licensed pharmacist while in school and studying for my exams it was heavily implied that medical professionals should be of good moral character and this is for good reason of course 

Well I am acquaintances with a recently graduated RN and have her on Facebook Ive known her for years and have noticed over time that she has a low opinion of Asian people that she has vocalized several times I do have screenshots of her making jokes about how she hopes the Chinese restaurant down the street doesnt steal her cat and how she hopes she isnt eating cat meat when she posts pictures of her Chinese take out 

In person Ive heard her make remarks about how COVID was Chinese peoples fault and other racist comments concerning that situation 

I had no idea she was pursuing her RN until she posted having recently graduated and taking her NCLEX My immediate thought was that I hope she never has any Asian patients because I really dont think they would be receiving appropriate or safe care from her I myself am Chinese and I know that I would feel extremely uncomfortable receiving care from her or having her provide care to any of my relatives 

I have half a mind to report her to the Board of Nursing and providing the screenshots off of her Facebook joking about the Chinese restaurants stealing cats and cooking them into food But I dont know if it would be worth it would anything even be done I truly dont think someone who has racist thoughts and feels comfortable enough expressing them publicly needs to be in healthcare 

Im looking for advice on if anyone else thinks this is worth pursuing or if Im just thinking about it too much If you think it is worth pursuing is there any kind of retaliation professionally or socially I can face making the report Is it anonymous Im also recently licensed as a pharmacist so Im very new to all of this Any thoughts would be very much appreciated thank you for taking the time to read",Positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromThePharmacy/comments/1iz2uqu/asking_for_advice_concerning_a_rn_displaying/

Update with the campaign 😊 | Ashtro the White Cat Chose Us 🐾,"Previous post 

We named him Ashtro He suddenly showed up on February 21 but went missing when we were about to feed him Then on February 23 we saw him again in the area We decided to take him because he was struggling with a cough and cold It kinda feels like he chose usmaybe because he felt safe with us 

We isolated him for now since we dont know where he came from and of course for the safety of our other rescues too 

February 26 we were finally able to bring him to the vet with the help of our donors Ashtro had a CBC and virus test FCoV  FHVthankfully he tested negative But his CBC results showed an infection which explains his cough and cold He also had a lot of fleas so he got Broadline for ticks and fleas He started his meds and his followup checkup is on March 5 

Ashtro is in need of nebulizer equipment for his cough and cold If anyone wants to help Ashtro were accepting any kind of donation Feel free to message us Every little bit helps

My wife's OB/GYN is giving questionable advice.,"I went with my wife to her first OBGYN appointment of the pregnancy today The doctor said some things that didnt sound right and my followup research has caused some concern that the doctor doesnt know what shes talking about

While the doctor was talking about what my wife should and shouldnt eat she told my wife that she should avoid carbohydrates completely She particularly seemed focused on the potential of carbs causing weight gain in the mother as opposed to anything related to the health of the baby To clarify she said that any carbs at all were bad and that bread cereal and any other carbs are to be avoided This sounded wrong to me as I know that carbs are necessary for all humans so I did some further research According to several reputable sources including Johns Hopkins and the National Institute of Health carbs are important to the development of the baby From the NIH To support normal fetal growth and brain development it is advised to consume an additional 35 g of carbohydrates per day during pregnancy The only sources I found that said to avoid carbs were about avoiding weight gain during pregnancy

It seems that what the doctor said had a lot more to do with vanity and appearances as opposed to prevailing medical science which has led me to question whether or not she we need to make a change Has anyone else heard anything like this or does my wife need to find a new OBGYN",Positive,https://www.reddit.com/r/obgyn/comments/1iz2uuk/my_wifes_obgyn_is_giving_questionable_advice/

Allergies...?,"Hey Reddit once again I come here to ask for help My cat Polly F 11 indoor she is allergic to chicken beef and fish she also cant eat insect food because it gives her constipation we found out she had an allergy for those proteins because last year she started to have diarrhea and infections on her nails we change the food and now she is eating dry Horse food and Deer wet food both monoproteins because she needs an antiinflammatory for her arthritis we decided to get her another mono protein to give her the medicine so I think last month she started to eat kangaroo also mono protein

For the last two weeks or so I have seen her scratching herself and also cleaning a lot she got herself like a tiny patch without hair in her paw but after taking care of it now the hair is growing back but yesterday I found this bald spot behind her ear a sorr of dented mark on her nose and a bit of black gunk in the inbetween on her paws and a bit on the lip  she also takes asthma medication that we stopped using because there was a shortage she just started to use it again two days ago and its also good to mention the asthma and the food allergy happened at the same time when she started the asthma medication her nail infection disappeared completely out of nowhere her nails are still brittle and when I cut her nails it peels somehow I am indeed going to the vet but we are also moving so I dont know if this could also be stress lack of the asthma medication or the kangaroo Ill make an appoiment for next week at the new vet when we finish moving on Sunday because our current vet doesnt have any openings this week  somebody has an idea

Gi Nattack Hard Mode is BS… Please help,"TLDR at the bottom

Currently doing my hard mode play through rn and havent had too much trouble so far Challenging and a bit unfair at times but nothing too bad That is until chapter 10 when you fight this monstrosity of game designing Im not one to rage at video games or speak ill of the people who make them but this shit has thrown all that away and I pray that whatever masochist designed this fight gets cucked Pls tell me Im not the only one that thinks this is a terrible fight No elemental weakness which makes things harder but Im not too mad at that Red and Barrett combo should be illegal Red is okay with maneuvering and can do damage with certain abilities and Barrett does real good damage but is just a fucking log Anytime Im not controlling him he just takes the full brunt of every attack and makes it so I constantly have to use pray which not only leaves me vulnerable but also wastes precious ATB I could be using to unleash strong attacks and also build towards my limits When I am controlling him its better but then Red just gets destroyed Not to mention he just teleports behind you every 2 seconds and uses that stupid drain ability thats practically unavoidable at least to avoid completely and does decent damage Dont even get me started on that grab thing he does that drains all your hp unless you have a full bar And if his mechanics werent broken enough he spawns souls that you have to beat quickly or they one shot you and while youre doing that he has free range to just unload on you its actually insane a professional dev thought this was a good design Then once hes half health he just halves all your stats and makes the arena smaller and just unleashes an unavoidable nonstop combo And the worst thing of all thats genuinely making me hate the people who made this game is his doom ability This game has so many stupid bosses that have a dumb one shot ability where you have to meet whatever conditions or its instant death which is dumb asf and I have no idea why theyre so obsessed with it rather than just making the bosses good but whatever Anyway this one takes the cake You have like 90 seconds to kill over a quarter of his health which is borderline impossible unless you have limits saved up but its hard to get his health low without dying if you dont use limits earlier so its not very practical So annoying because they literally just punish you for no reason even if you plow through him no problem Ive gotten to this part 8 times and 3 of them he had the tiniest sliver of health when I got insta deathed This is my favorite game and I love pretty much everything about it and this is the second to last step to obtaining platinum but at this point I barely even want it This game throws so much bs at you post game Call it a skill issue but Ive platinumed games much harder than Rebirth as a base but they were actually fair where this game just makes some things post game like chadleys simulator and some hard mode bosses so unfair 

TLDR

Ranted too much but anyone have a way to cheese this fight I never cheese so really just tips that are helpful because I dont even care at this point I just want to move on or its genuinely gonna ruin my love for the game My main problem is taking too much damage and having to use heals and pray too often which lengthens the fight and makes killing him post second stagger impossible The fight as a whole is annoying but its really the last part that I need the help with most because I wouldve beaten him second try if that timer wasnt a thing Any help is appreciated Thanks",Negative,https://www.reddit.com/r/FFVIIRemake/comments/1iz2uyu/gi_nattack_hard_mode_is_bs_please_help/

Please help with girls,"I am in the second year of university and am still a virgin I feel immense social pressure to get laid and every time I see a pretty girl of which there are many on campus I am reminded of being incompetent and like my masculinity has been upset I tend to pick skills up quickly but I just cannot get a girl I am even ready to settle for a one off fling 

I have chatted to girls and gone with oneonone walks a few times but its so hard to be affectionate and genuine and its so exhausting I just want to collapse and fall asleep at the end of it 

I once had a make out session with a girl when we were both drunk I a lot more than her but I do not think of that as an achievement 

Please I would appreciate any advice I feel like I cannot be satisfied with myself until I get laid  I have a high libido abstaining from porn has not been a problem for me though although I masturbate a lot I really like girls and fantasise a lot about them and I feel so incompetent wanting them so much and not being able to muster the social skills I feel like it would be easy to have a really deep relationship but I just cant get past the initial stage Also I feel the easiest girls to talk to are the ones I dont like I would feel so much weight of my shoulders if I knew I had the ability to get laid 

Im in very good shape as lifting weights is a passion of mine I do have a hunched back when Im not paying attention but other than that Im pretty attractive its my social skills that are dragging me down plus great social skills can over come being ugly
